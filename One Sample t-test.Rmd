## One Sample t-test ( Manual )

```{r include=FALSE}
options (digits = 6)
options (scipen = 5)
```

>*Question: Is the average speed of cars that drive down Reservoir Rd. in* 
>*Harrisonburg, Virgina more than 5 miles per hour (mph) above the speed limit ?* 

- Step 0: Check your assumptions
- Step 1: Set Null and alternate hypothesis
- Step 2: Choose alpha, Level of Significance
- Step 3: Calcualte the Test Statistic
- Step 4: Draw a picture
- Step 5: Find the p-value
- Step 6: Is the p-value < $\alpha$ ? If so, Reject the Null
- Step 7: Also Compute a Confidence Interval to DoubleCheck

&nbsp;

##### Step 0: Assumptions
- Random Sample
- Observations are Independent
- Sample is less than 10% of the entire population size
- Differences are nearly normal or the Sample size is atleast more than 30. 

&nbsp;

##### **Step 1**: Set Hypothesis
- Set null hypothesis $H_0$. mu.zero = 30 miles per hour
- Set alternate hypothesis $H_a$. sample.mean > 30 miles per hour 

&nbsp;

##### **Step 2**: Choose $\alpha$
- Set $\alpha$ = 0.05 (I will reject null, only if there is strong evidence that people are driving fast. So will be incorrect only 5 times out of 100)

```{r}
alpha = 0.05

```


&nbsp;

##### **Step 3**: Calculate t-statistic

$$t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{SE(\bar{x})} \qquad where,\enspace  SE(\bar{x}) = SD(\bar{x}) / \sqrt{n} $$

&nbsp;

```{r}
mu_zero = 30
sample_mean = 33
sample_sd = 5.6 
nr_of_samples = 32

t = (sample_mean - mu_zero) / (sample_sd / sqrt(nr_of_samples))
print(t)
```

&nbsp;

##### **Step 4**: Plot the Sampling Distribution of mean
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=5}
source("shadenorm.R")

shadenorm(between=c(t,Inf), color="violet", title("Sampling Distribution of the Mean"))

```


##### **Step 5**: Calculate `P-Value`

&nbsp;

```{r}
p_value = 1-pt(t, df = nr_of_samples-1 )  #100% of the total area under the t distribution minus the area to the left of t-statistic. 
print(p_value)

```

&nbsp;

##### **Step 6**: Is the `P-Value` < $\alpha$

&nbsp;

```{r echo=FALSE}
if (p_value < alpha) {
  print ("P-Value is less the alpha, Reject the Null Hypothesis !")
} else {
  print ("P-Value is not less the alpha, so Fail to Reject the Null Hypothesis !")
}

```

&nbsp;

##### **Step 7**: Confidence Interval

&nbsp;

$$ Confidence Interval \enspace = \enspace \bar{x} \pm t_{critical} * SE(\bar{x}) \enspace = \enspace \bar{x} \pm t_{critical} * \frac{SD(\bar{x})}{\sqrt{n}} $$

```{r}
area = 1-alpha      #100% - 5% = 95%. For two-tailed test it will be 1-(alpha/2) 

t_critical = qt(area, df = nr_of_samples-1)  #Critical value of t at 95%. For two-tailed we will calcuate the critical value at 97.5%. Since t-distribution is symmetric critical value at 2.5% will be same. 

sprintf("Critical value for %s%% confidence interval - One sided test is: %s",(1-alpha)*100, t_critical)

```

&nbsp;

```{r}

confidence_lower_limit = sample_mean - (t_critical * sample_sd/sqrt(nr_of_samples))

confidence_upper_limit = sample_mean + (t_critical * sample_sd/sqrt(nr_of_samples))

sprintf ("%s%% Confidence level of sample mean is between %s and %s",(1-alpha)*100, confidence_lower_limit, confidence_upper_limit)

```

&nbsp; 

## One Sample t-test - Using R

&nbsp; 

##### Create input samples variable. 

```{r}
speeds = c(29, 25, 22, 34, 38, 40, 27, 29, 30, 30, 23, 34, 42, 36, 35, 27, 37)
```

&nbsp; 

##### Perform One sided t-test

```{r}
t.test(speeds, mu=mu_zero, alternative="greater")

```

&nbsp; 

>*In R, the confidence interval calculation will be different while performing one-side test in R and not expected as we want. So to know the correct confidence interval, we need to remove the option alternative="greater" for performing two-tailed test.* 

&nbsp; 

```{r}
t.test(speeds, mu=mu_zero)
```

>*Above is the Confidence Interval which we interested.*
